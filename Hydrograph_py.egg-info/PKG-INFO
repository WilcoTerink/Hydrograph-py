Description: Hydrograph-py
        =============
        
        Hydrograph-py is a hydrological Python package that provides some tools for:
        
          1. Separation of flow time-series into peak flow and baseflow.
          2. Filtering of peak flow events given a minimum event duration.
          3. Calculation of peak event volumes.
          4. Calculation of maximum annual peak flow and maximum annual peak event volume.
          5. Extreme value analysis using GEV fitting and plotting functions.
